# Nutri Macro

The macro recipe maker app came to me while I was on a fitness journey recently. As anybody in fitness will tell you, diet is 90% of exercise. Diet is also the hardest thing to track and come up with healthy/tasty recipes.

The MyFitnessPal app is an extremely useful tool in helping you track your calories, protein, carbs, and fat, but it does not easily portion out meals for you, nor does it provide recipes for your specific needs.

I personally found a few meals that were useful to me, but figuring out the portion sizes to fit my macro needs was extremely time consuming. I wish I had a calculator that would take my parameters of: 2600 calories, 140g protein, 100g carbs, and 50g fat, and return back to me a portioned out meal and recipe that called for: 10g chicken breast, 12g broccoli, and 6g of potatoes.

This way I would know exactly the portions and ingredients needed to make my meals.
